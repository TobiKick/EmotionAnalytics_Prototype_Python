# Visual-Emotion-Recognition
[Deep Learning] Prototype implementation for the Master's thesis 'Visual Emotion Recogntion in The Wild' using Keras @ University of Hamburg

## Goal:
Assessing the viability of Emotion Recognition for business use-cases in-the-wild based on facial expressions

## Tasks:
• Implementation of a state-of-the-art Deep Learning solution based on current literature<br/>
• Comparison of various Deep Learning methods through ablation study<br/>
• User experiment setup in order to verify the viability of Emotion Recognition to identify interest in a business context

## Outcome:
In this master thesis I could prove that my solution was able to outperform some state-of-the-art papers. Moreover, the experiment disproved the existence of a significant correlation between recognized emotional valence and the indicated interest by test participants

## Utilized tools:
• Python, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, cv2<br/>
• Pre-trained networks: MTCNN, VGGFace<br/>
• AFEW-VA dataset (https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/afew-va-database/)
